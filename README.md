# LingTab Frontend

A frontend applciation for LingTab, an app which plays two roles:

-   Keeping track of what Ian owes me
-   Understanding how Flutter interfaces with a web-based API

This frontend is written with the following technologies:

-   Flutter
-   Dart

This is technically a read-only app, so no authentication is required.
